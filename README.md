# Bigollo to the nth

These scripts are for reminding me how to calculate an nth number in the Fibonacci sequence, `F<sub>n</sub> = F<sub>n-1</sub> + F<sub>n-2</sub>`, given base cases/seed values are `F<sub>0</sub> = 0` and `F<sub>1</sub> = 1`.

Bigollo is supposedly another nickname for the mathematician known as Fibonacci.
