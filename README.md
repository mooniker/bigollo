# Bigollo to the nth

These scripts are for reminding me how to calculate an nth number in the Fibonacci sequence, `F<sup>n</sup> = F<sup>n-1</sup> + F<sup>n-2</sup>`, given base cases/seed values are `F<sup>0</sup> = 0` and `F<sup>1</sup> = 1`.

Bigollo is supposedly another nickname for the mathematician known as Fibonacci.
